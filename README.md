# The-4-Chip-Game

### INSTRUCTIONS: HOW TO PLAY ?
* The game consists of two players. Each player is denoted by a single colour, either blue or red.
* You can drop a chip by clicking on the top hole of the column. The chip will drop down to the first unoccupied hole from the bottom.
* Your task is to connect atleast 4 chips either row-wise, column-wise or diagonally. The first player to achieve this setup wins.
* Be smart, drop your chips in such a way that your opponent cannot connect his chips.
* **Make sure that you have fun!**

### DISCLAIMER:
This game is inspired from the famous tic-tac-toe.
I will be adding options for customization of the number of holes(user can manually select the m*n grids), animations of the chip falling and some fireworks( :p ) on winning the game.
This will be a purely HTML5, CSS and JS based game with no Adobe Plugin needed.
I might make an online version where you are connected to a random player or computer against you!
